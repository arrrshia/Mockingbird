# Inspiration

The Mockingbird call inspired me, and how they fend off perpetrators by imitating the call of multiple birds. Scientists believe that mockingbirds imitate the calls and songs of other birds to discourage other birds from settling in the mockingbirds’ territory by making it appear heavily populated.

# What it does

Mimics an iPhone call with a close to exact iPhone UI clone, with multiple call audios to choose from, to keep safe vulnerable people at night. In my case, the app, “Mockingbird”, will imitate a phone call where someone close to the user (father, brother, boyfriend, etc.) says that they are coming to pick them up and has a short conversation with the user until they actually do. The idea is that this would deter any possible perpetrator from thinking that the user is completely alone and an easy target.
